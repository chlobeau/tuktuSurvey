#### Steps

1. Make certain fields required. (document name, quote)

2. Make email forced to be correcty formatted. shinyvalidate package

  # Validation rules are set in the server, start by
  # making a new instance of an `InputValidator()`
  iv <- InputValidator$new()
  
  # Basic usage: `sv_email()` works well with its
  # defaults; a message will be displayed if the
  # validation of `input$email` fails
  iv$add_rule("email", sv_email())
  
  # Finally, `enable()` the validation rules
  iv$enable()

3. Make submit button clear the main panel

4. Make clear button for side panel

5. Where should these be saved that aren't just my laptop? SQL, google sheet? https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/persistent-data-storage.html
